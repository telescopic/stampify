    Finds the most interesting sequence for a

    Basic outline of algorithm:
    1: initialize seed stamp page
        go to step 2
    2: while stamp_pages can be picked
        > pick stamp page with best interestingness metric
        > remove it from the stamp pages so it wont be
            picked again
        > update last picked stamp page
        go to step 3
    3: if total count of stamp pages
        picked is less then max pages allowed go to step2
